# Hammerspoon

I use TextWrangler, available for free in the Mac App Store, to edit my configuration files in Hammerspoon

You can copy and paste my code (init.lua) to your init file. Then you can modify the app names, key bindings/shortcuts, and local x/y coordinates to suit your needs. You shouldn't need to edit the function names.
